# FMU Quix Integration

Quix enables developers to run FMU models in real-time streaming pipelines.  
This repository brings together different integration options, depending on your needs and MATLAB version.

## Why This Project?

he Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is an open standard that enables the exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models across different tools. Models packaged as Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) are widely used in mechanical, automotive, and multi-physics engineering.

However, integrating FMUs into real-time streaming pipelines is not always straightforward. With Quix, you can:
	‚Ä¢	Ingest live data from Kafka topics into your FMU models
	‚Ä¢	Run simulations or co-simulations in real time
	‚Ä¢	Stream the FMU outputs back to Kafka for monitoring, control, or analytics
